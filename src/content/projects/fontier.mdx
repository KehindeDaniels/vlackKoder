## The Inspiration

So, I posted a **“long”** post on LinkedIn. But here's the thing—LinkedIn’s text box is _very_ basic. You can’t make your text **bold**, _italic_, 𝐬̶𝐭̶𝐫̶𝐢̶𝐤̶𝐞̶𝐭̶𝐡̶𝐫̶𝐨̶𝐮̶𝐠̶𝐡̶, or even <u>underline</u> for that extra emphasis.

And in content or technical writing, styling text brings more life and structure to your message. So, how did I style my post?

## So, What did I do

I built my own little text editor — **Fontier**.

Created with **Vanilla JavaScript**, styled using **Tailwind CSS**, and lovingly named using whatever sweet-sounding name came to mind 😂 — _Fontier_ helps you add flair to your words and paste styled text **anywhere**, including LinkedIn and Twitter.

Whether it's:

- Bold
- Italic
- Underlined
- Strikethrough

Fontier keeps the style when you paste. And now…
Guess what?🙂‍↔️ it’s even a **Chrome extension**!😮‍💨

But locally🙈🌚, the site is live, but the extesion isn't... dont worry, soon I'l deploy it. I faced some issues thats giving me serious headache 😭

## My Contribution

- Well, starting as a designer, I made the design myself
- Built UI with just HTML and Tailwind CSS
- Wrote all JavaScript logic for formatting behavior (missed vanilla, I wanted a taste of it- who dosen't miss the simplicity of develoment- html, css and js fiolder😭, now, my file structure is like the tree if lyfe😭)
- Packaged it into a working Chrome Extension
- Published on Vercel and deployed in 2 days
