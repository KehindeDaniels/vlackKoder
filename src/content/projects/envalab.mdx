## The Problem

Laboratories had trouble keeping track of inventory — lots of paper, lots of chaos.

## The Solutions

I built **Envalab**, a lab inventory management system. It digitizes everything — from stock levels to usage reports — all in one place.

## My Contribution

- Architected frontend with Next.js
- Integrated backend logic with Node.js
- Designed UI system in Figma before building

## Learnings

This project helped me understand how to build scalable dashboards and improved my skills in component architecture.
