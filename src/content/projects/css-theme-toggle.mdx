## The Motivation

Wait â€” a CSS-only project in a portfolio?  
I know what you're thinking, but hear me out.

This project was a turning point in my CSS journey. Not only did I build a light/dark mode toggle, but I also implemented a fully responsive dropdown navigation â€” all without writing a single line of JavaScript.

## Why It Matters

If you ask me why Iâ€™m so proud of this project, hereâ€™s why:

It was at this moment CSS became second nature.  
I understood its power. The logic. The flow.  
And I realized I could now design **any** UI with pure CSS.

## Key Features

- âœ… Light/Dark theme toggle (no JavaScript!)
- âœ… Dropdown navigation with hover & focus support
- âœ… Responsive hamburger menu using CSS toggles

## Under the Hood

### Theme Toggling

The theme toggle works by checking the `input:checked` state â€” and using the `:has()` selector to cascade dark mode styles across the layout:

```css
.theme:has(input:checked)::after {
  left: 0;
}

.toggle__mode:has(input:checked) ~ div {
  --bck--color: rgb(31 41 55);
  --txt--color: white;
  --hover-btn: white;
}
```

This allows you to update multiple variables using a single user interaction â€” no JavaScript event listener needed.

### Hamburger Menu

The hamburger icon rotates and transforms into an "X" using `::before` and `::after`, triggered by the checkbox:

```css
.hamburger:has(input:checked) {
  rotate: 45deg;
}

.hamburger:has(input:checked)::before {
  rotate: -90deg;
  translate: 0 0.5rem;
}

.hamburger:has(input:checked)::after {
  opacity: 0;
}
```

The `:has()` selector is magic here â€” it allows state-based styling just like React state, but with plain CSS.

### Dropdown Navigation

Hereâ€™s how I made hover/focus dropdowns work with just CSS:

```css
.main__nav ul li a:hover + ul,
.main__nav ul li a:focus + ul {
  visibility: visible;
  transform: translateY(0);
}
```

Combined with semantic HTML and `tabindex`, this ensures keyboard accessibility too.

## Learnings

This project taught me how far you can go with CSS alone.
It also sharpened my understanding of:

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox & Grid
- Advanced selectors like `:has()` and `::after`
- Responsive, accessible layouts

And most importantly: writing code that feels _fun_.

## Final Thoughts

Sometimes, simplicity is innovation.
This wasnâ€™t just a theme toggle â€” it was a demonstration of how far CSS has come and whatâ€™s now possible when you understand it deeply.

âœ… Just save this as:

```

content/projects/css-theme-toggle.mdx

```

And update your `projectData.ts` to include this slug (`slug: "css-theme-toggle"`) so it shows up with a case link.

Let me know if you'd like help updating the `projectData` entry or need a card image!
